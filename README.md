## Getting started 

To get started with running my tech test, you'll firstly need to create a database and a `.env` file and then fill in the database variables in the `.env` file.

- 1. Create a database
- 2. update the .env file with your DB settings


## Seeding the data
To run the seeder, navigate to the project directory and run `php artisan db:seed`


##Â Using the API with postman
As the API is setup to accept and return JSON formatted data, you should add the following headers to your requests:

`Accept: application/json`
`Content-Type: application/json`

## Task 1 
In this task I created a class to simplify fetching from the dog.ceo API, I did this to keep the code clean rather than littered with Guzzle requests, this also meant that I didn't need to re-write the logic to fetch the list of breeds from the API. 

I utilised this in the Seeder too to fetch and store the breeds from the API. 

*NOTE* :

 I think I may have misinterpreted something along the way, I was specifically confused with the requirement to expose routes like `/breed` and `/breed/{breed_id}`, my interpretation was to expose some endpoints from laravel to act as a passthrough to the dog.ceo API.  I was anticipating that these routes would be required for the RESTful routes for the next part of the test where the CRUD operations are performed.

This lead me to using `/breeds` for the second task, I hope this suffices.

## Task 2

I hadn't used Redis with Laravel so this was my first time, I wasn't sure if I had implemented this correctly, but it seems to be working. I added a message to the responses to indicate where the data was provided from (cache / database).

To test this, you'll need to ensure you have a local redis server running and the correct configuration.

## Task 3
